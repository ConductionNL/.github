As a result of our mission and values, we've embarked on a journey of creating open-source software components. These components are designed to empower government agencies and organizations to build more accessible, transparent, and efficient digital solutions for their citizens.

Our commitment to open source reflects our belief in the principles of democracy, inclusivity, and transparency. We want to enable everyone to participate in the digital transformation and contribute to the betterment of society.
