# Overview of Conduction Services

Welcome to Conduction's service portfolio! We offer a wide range of services and solutions to meet your digital needs. Our services are divided into five main categories: SLA/SAAS, Implementation, Development, Training, and Consultancy.

## SLA/SAAS (Service Level Agreements / Software as a Service)

The main difference between our SLA and SAAS offerings lies in the hosting responsibility. With an SLA, the client is responsible for hosting - either through their own infrastructure or via a third-party hosting provider like Cyso. With SAAS, Conduction handles the hosting entirely.

Both options provide the same high-quality service and support, just with different hosting arrangements to suit your specific needs and requirements.
