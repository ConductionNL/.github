# Organizational Structure

At Conduction, we maintain a clear organizational structure that promotes collaboration, innovation, and efficient delivery of solutions. Here's an overview of our organization:

![Organization Structure](../Diagrams/Organisation.svg)

## Organizational Levels

### Shareholders
Our shareholder structure consists of three entities:
- Shareholder 1 B.V.
- Shareholder 2 B.V. 
- Shareholder 3 B.V.

### Board
Currently, our board consists of:
- General Director (Algemeen Directeur / Chief Executive Officer)

#### Strategic Focus
The board operates exclusively at a strategic level, focusing on:
- Long-term organizational vision and direction
- Strategic decision-making and policy development
- Overall company performance and growth
- Stakeholder relationships and accountability
- Risk management and compliance oversight
- Corporate governance

This strategic focus ensures that:
- The organization maintains its long-term vision while the Leadership Team handles operational execution
- Strategic decisions are made with consideration of market trends and organizational capabilities
- Resources are allocated in alignment with long-term objectives
- The organization maintains proper governance and oversight

#### Future Board Development
While our current board structure is intentionally lean with a single Chief Executive Officer, we have a strategic vision for board expansion that aligns with our organizational growth. This measured approach to board development ensures that our governance structure evolves in harmony with:

- **Organizational Scale**: Board expansion will parallel our company's growth in size and complexity
- **Operational Needs**: Additional board positions will be created to address specific organizational requirements
- **Market Demands**: Board composition will adapt to changing market conditions and opportunities
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Board structure will evolve to meet governance requirements as we grow

Potential future board positions may include:
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- Chief Operations Officer (COO)

The timing and sequence of these additions will be carefully considered to ensure they:
- Add clear value to organizational governance
- Support sustainable growth
- Maintain efficient decision-making processes
- Provide appropriate oversight and leadership

This approach allows us to maintain agile decision-making in our current phase while having a clear vision for scaling our governance structure as the organization matures.

### Leadership Team
Our organization intentionally operates with a Leadership Team rather than a traditional Management Team. This distinction is fundamental to our organizational philosophy and way of working.

#### Leadership vs Management Approach
We believe in "first among equals" rather than traditional top-down management. Our Leadership Team members are:
- Actively involved in daily operations alongside their teams
- Leading by example and expertise rather than position
- Both team members and team leaders simultaneously
- Focused on enabling and empowering their teams

#### Operational Focus
The Leadership Team operates primarily at an operational level:
- Meets weekly to address operational concerns
- Ensures cross-team collaboration and alignment
- Resolves operational challenges
- Facilitates knowledge sharing between teams
- Implements strategic decisions in daily operations

#### Team Integration
Leadership Team members maintain a dual role:
- End responsibility for their team's performance and development
- Active participation in their team's daily work
This approach ensures leaders stay connected to operational realities while guiding their teams.

#### Expected Competencies for Leadership Team Members
- Strategic thinking: Ability to develop and implement long-term vision
- Strong leadership skills: Inspiring, decisive, and capable of driving team excellence
- Communication skills: Effective in both written and verbal interactions with various stakeholders
- Analytical insight: Ability to translate data into actionable insights and decisions
- Results-oriented: Focus on achieving impactful and measurable results

#### Key Responsibilities
- Anticipates long-term challenges and drives continuous improvement
- Operates autonomously in line with organizational strategy and objectives
- Creates a results-driven work environment and positive atmosphere
- Clearly communicates decisions and expectations
- Creates commitment among employees and teams
- Provides constructive feedback and coaching
- Resolves conflicts effectively

## Team Leads

### Expected Competencies for Team Leads
- Strong communication skills
- Connecting and coaching leadership
- Analytical ability to identify problems and opportunities
- Results-oriented with focus on quality
- Flexibility and solution-oriented thinking

### Key Responsibilities
- Anticipates long-term challenges within their domain
- Resolves complex issues requiring helicopter view and expertise
- Operates autonomously within goals and budget
- Provides content and/or hierarchical guidance

### Differences between Team Lead and Leadership Team
1. Strategic vs Operational
   - Leadership Team: Focus on strategic and long-term goals
   - Team Lead: Focus on operational execution

2. Cross-departmental Responsibility
   - Leadership Team: Responsible for positioning their department within the organization
   - Team Lead: Focus on department-specific goals

3. Vision and Innovation
   - Leadership Team: Key role in shaping innovation and strategic development
   - Team Lead: Contributing to execution of innovation initiatives


## Functions vs Roles

In our organization, we distinguish between functions and roles:

### Functions
- Formal, established positions
- Specific and structural
- Fixed tasks and responsibilities
- Part of employment agreement
- Long-term focused

### Roles
- Flexible task collections
- Context-dependent
- Can be filled by multiple persons
- Focused on collaboration and results
- Can change based on team needs

This structure allows us to maintain clear organizational hierarchy while enabling the flexibility needed in a modern, agile environment.
