## üßô Who is Conduction?

At Conduction, we are driven by a vision that sees the digitization of the world as an extraordinary opportunity. It's a chance to transform our world into something more democratic, inclusive, and transparent. We understand that digitalization is not just inevitable but comes with immense potential and challenges.

**Our Mission** is to shape this new digital world into a fair and inclusive environment for everyone, while also safeguarding it against the threats posed by digitalization. We firmly believe that achieving this goal requires us to adhere to the fundamental principles and rights of humanity.

Our mission is simple yet profound: **"Make the digital world a better place for its citizens by creating democratic, inclusive, transparent, understandable, and affordable software for citizens."**

## Our (Big Hairy Audacious) Goal

We have set a bold goal for ourselves: **"By 2035, Conduction ensures that all residents of the Netherlands automatically receive the government services they are entitled to."**

Imagine a world where no one falls through the cracks of our social support system. Where a single mother doesn't miss out on crucial childcare benefits simply because she wasn't aware they existed. Where elderly citizens automatically receive the care and support they're entitled to, without having to navigate complex application procedures. Where those with limited literacy or digital skills aren't left behind in accessing essential government services.

Today, many citizens, especially those who are less educated or digitally skilled, miss out on benefits and support they're legally entitled to. They might struggle with complex forms, be unaware of available services, or feel overwhelmed by bureaucratic procedures. This creates an unfair system where those who need help the most are often least likely to receive it.

Through proactive service delivery, we envision a future where government services automatically reach citizens when they need them. Instead of citizens having to search for and apply to various schemes, the government proactively identifies their needs and ensures they receive appropriate support. This shift from reactive to proactive service delivery will create a more equitable society where everyone receives the support they're entitled to, regardless of their educational background, digital literacy, or social circumstances.

## Our Core Values: The Foundation of Our 2035 Goal

To achieve our ambitious goal of ensuring all Dutch residents automatically receive their entitled government services by 2035, we need strong foundational values that guide our approach. Here's how our core values directly support this mission:

<TabItem value="current" label="Current Values" default>

**Democratic:** To create truly automated and proactive government services, we must incorporate diverse perspectives and needs. By actively seeking input from all stakeholders and valuing feedback, we ensure our solutions work for everyone, not just the digitally savvy.

**Inclusive:** Automatic service delivery can only succeed if it reaches ALL citizens. Our commitment to creating solutions where everyone feels respected, supported, and valued ensures we don't leave anyone behind - whether they're elderly, disabled, or digitally challenged.

 **Transparent:** For citizens to trust automated government services, they need to understand how decisions are made. Our dedication to open communication and honest operations builds this crucial trust, helping citizens feel confident in receiving proactive services.

**Responsible and Sustainable:** Automated service delivery must be built to last. We develop solutions that not only serve current citizens but are sustainable for future generations, ensuring our 2035 goal creates lasting positive change.

**Innovative:** Achieving universal automatic service delivery requires creative solutions to complex challenges. Our commitment to innovation and efficiency drives us to find new ways to identify citizen needs and deliver services proactively, making our 2035 goal achievable.

<TabItem value="proposed" label="Proposed Values">

**Innovative:** Innovation is at the heart of achieving our 2035 goal. We don't just follow trends - we create solutions that truly transform government service delivery. When working with clients, this means we actively explore cutting-edge technologies and creative approaches. For example, instead of building another form portal, we might suggest using AI to proactively identify citizen needs.

**Knowledgeable:** Deep expertise is crucial for revolutionizing government services. We continuously invest in learning and understanding both technology and government processes. Clients experience this through our ability to provide strategic guidance - we don't just build what's asked for, but help shape solutions based on our comprehensive understanding of the digital government landscape.

**Contrarian:** To achieve automatic service delivery by 2035, we must challenge conventional thinking in government IT. The public sector often sticks to outdated technologies and standards due to risk aversion and institutional inertia. When a client requests a traditional solution based on legacy systems, we dare to propose modern alternatives that better serve citizens. For example, while many government organizations still rely heavily on local proprietary standards, we advocate for adopting international open standards that enable integration with the broader software ecosystem. This constructive contrarian attitude helps break the "we've always done it this way" mindset that slows digital innovation in government. By thoughtfully questioning established practices and introducing proven new technologies, we help modernize public services while managing risks responsibly.

**Cooperative:** We believe that transforming government services requires working together. Rather than competing, we actively seek partnerships with other companies - even competitors - because achieving our 2035 goal is more important than individual success. Clients see this in how we:
- Openly share knowledge and code with the community
- Connect clients with other vendors when their solutions might be a better fit
- Build upon existing open-source solutions instead of reinventing the wheel
- Actively participate in and contribute to various open-source communities
